## Large summation

The multiples of 5 are: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35...

The multiples of 7 are: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35...

If we add the multiples of 5 and 7 that are less than 40, we get:

5 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 20 + 21 + 25 + 28 + 30 + 35 = 210

What is the sum of the multiples of 5 and 7 that are less than 1 million?

 
## Recursively defined sequence

Let the function f(n) return (n / 2) if n is even, and (1 + 3 * n) if n is odd.

Examples:
•	f(1) = 4
•	f(2) = 1
•	f(3) = 10
•	f(4) = 2

The function a(n) returns a sequence of numbers. That sequence is determined as follows:
•	The initial element is n.
•	Each subsequent element is the function f applied to the previous element.
•	The sequence terminates after it evaluates to 1.

Example: a(3) returns[3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
•	n=3, so that is the first element.
•	We apply f to the previous element. f(3) is 10, so that is the second element.
•	We continue: f(10) = 5, f(5) = 16, f(16) = 8, f(8) = 4, f(2) = 1.
•	We terminate after the sequence reaches 1.

The sum of the elements returned by a(3) is 3 + 10 + 5 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 49.

What is the sum of the elements returned by a(6171)?
